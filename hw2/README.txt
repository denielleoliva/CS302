What is the program?

This program establishes basic stack functionality. This includes stack
manipulation functionality like pushing to a stack and popping values from the
a stack. Using these functions, the program utilizes them in two different
practices. One being a postfix evalutation process. The other a balanced 
delimiter check.

The postfix evaluation portion of the project evaluates a postfix expression
and return the correct result. This section uses the linked stack 
implementation
