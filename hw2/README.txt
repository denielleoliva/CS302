What is the program?

This program establishes basic stack functionality. This includes stack
manipulation functionality like pushing to a stack and popping values from the
a stack. Using these functions, the program utilizes them in two different
practices. One being a postfix evalutation process. The other a balanced 
delimiter check.

The postfix evaluation portion of the project evaluates a postfix expression
and return the correct result. This section uses the linked stack 
implementation in order to find the correct result of a postfix expression.

For example, the postfix expression 34+52/* should evaluate to 17.5.

Test cases for this program are in the attached logs.
