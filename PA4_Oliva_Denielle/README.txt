What is the project?

This project was meant for us to implement a Red Black Tree code package
provided by http://www.teachsolaisgames.com/articles/balanced_left_leaning.html.
The code package provided a huge bulk of the functionality needed to finish the
project, but students were responsible for creating additional functions to have
the requirements of the project fulfilled. 

When beginning the project I was unsure as to what I needed to implement from the 
code package. I was confused on what files were needed for the assignment. I 
figured out that I only needed three files from the original code package. Those 
files were LeftLeaningRedBlack.h, LeftLeaningRedBlack.cpp, and VoidRef.h. On top
of these files I needed to create my own main file as well as a Makefile. 

To run this program you just need to run the command make in the terminal. The 
result of the program can be found in the folder provided as a png file.
